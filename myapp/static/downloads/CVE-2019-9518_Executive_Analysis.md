CVE-2019-9518 is a critical denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affecting certain implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol.

**Impact:**
- **Availability Risk:** High - The vulnerability can lead to complete service downtime, significantly disrupting business operations and productivity.
- **Business Impact:** Systems dependent on affected HTTP/2 services will face interruptions, potentially affecting customer trust and causing revenue losses.
- **Legal and Compliance:** Businesses could face regulatory repercussions due to non-compliance with service availability requirements.

**Problem:** The vulnerability stems from the processing of a flood of empty HTTP/2 frames. Attackers exploit this to consume CPU resources disproportionately, leading to server unresponsiveness and potential downtime.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Update Systems:** Ensure all system components utilizing HTTP/2 are updated with the latest security patches.
2. **Install Protections:** deploy web application firewalls and enforce rate limiting to mitigate abuse from malicious traffic.
3. **Monitor Systems:** Implement and maintain robust logging and monitoring, enabling rapid detection and response to attack attempts.
4. **Employee Training:** Raise awareness and train IT staff to recognize and respond to signs of this specific vulnerability being exploited.
