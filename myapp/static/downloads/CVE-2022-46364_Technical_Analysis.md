Apache CXF versions before 3.5.5 and 3.4.10 are vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack due to improper parsing of the href attribute of XOP:Include in MTOM requests. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-46364, stems from CWE-918 (SSRF). Attackers can exploit this flaw to manipulate the application server to send unauthorized requests to internal systems or services, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing further compromise. 


Mitigation and defenses include strict input validation, setting up proper access controls to restrict unauthorized network access, and monitoring web traffic for anomalous activities. Use web application firewalls (WAFs) to help mitigate this vector. Regular patching and updates to newer, fixed versions of Apache CXF are essential to ensure systems are not vulnerable to known exploits.
