CVE-2019-9518 is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in some HTTP/2 implementations. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending a stream of valid HTTP/2 frames with empty payloads. The receiving server processes these frames disproportionately, leading to CPU resource exhaustion.

**Impact:**
- **Availability Impact:** High - The server becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.
- **Network Impact:** High - This type of attack can generate significant load on the network.

**Affected Systems:**
- Apple SwiftNIO (versions 1.0.0 - 1.4.0)
- Apache Traffic Server (versions 6.0.0 - 6.2.3, 7.0.0 - 7.1.6, 8.0.0 - 8.0.3)
- Various affected Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, SUSE, and Red Hat systems
- Synology DiskStation Manager and SkyNAS
- Node.js various versions

**Related Attack Techniques:**
- T1499.002 - DoS Attack: Application DoS
- T1499 - DoS Attack: Network DoS
- T1495 - Supply Chain Compromise (by exploiting vulnerabilities in certain versions of software)

**Defense Techniques:**
1. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Deploy WAFs configured to detect and block HTTP/2 abuse signatures.
2. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on web servers to prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
3. **Traffic Analysis:** Implement anomaly detection systems which can alert on or respond to unexpected spikes in network traffic or requests.
4. **Server Hardening:** Keep systems and software updated to patch known vulnerabilities and frequently audit for any configurations or behaviors that deviate from the baseline.

**Defense Procedures:**
- Regularly update and patch HTTP/2 supported software.
- Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the surface of automated attacks.
- Implement logging and monitoring to detect anomaly in HTTP/2 frame rates or patterns.
- Apply WAF rules specific to known attacks against HTTP/2.
- Create custom alerts for unusually high numbers of HTTP/2 frame requests.
