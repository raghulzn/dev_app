The vulnerability CVE-2021-4034, identified in polkit's pkexec utility, is a local privilege escalation flaw. The issue arises because pkexec does not correctly handle the number of calling parameters and ends up trying to execute environment variables as commands. This improper handling allows attackers to craft environment variables that induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When exploited, this vulnerability can escalate unprivileged user access to administrative rights. Various attack techniques such as Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068), Services Execution (T1574.010), Create or Modify System Process (T1543), and Process Injection (T1055.001) could leverage this vulnerability. The associated weaknesses are CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which underlie the mismanagement of memory and parameters in pkexec. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to apply security updates as recommended by the vendor. Additionally, organizations should implement robust monitoring to detect unauthorized changes and potential exploitation activities. Regularly auditing environment variable usage and enforcing strict access controls add layers of defense.
