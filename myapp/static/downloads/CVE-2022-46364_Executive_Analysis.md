CVE-2022-46364 identified a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache CXF before versions 3.5.5 and 3.4.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the system by sending malicious MTOM requests, potentially gaining unauthorized access to internal services or sensitive data. The critical severity (9.8/10) indicates a high risk of exploitation, leading to significant data breaches or system compromises.

To mitigate this risk, it's vital to ensure all systems are updated to patched versions and to enforce rigorous network access controls and input validation measures. Regular monitoring and analysis of web application traffic can identify and block any unexpected activities, thereby reducing the potential for SSRF attacks. Implementing a robust security framework, including Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), can help mitigate such vulnerabilities.
